# Eastenders-NLP-Classification

This project focuses on analyzing dialogue from EastEnders characters to classify them using natural language processing (NLP). The goal was to build and improve vector representations for each character and use them in a similarity-based classification task.

## Overview

I used vector space semantics to analyze speech patterns and distinguish characters from the EastEnders script data. The project involved pre-processing text, extracting features like TF-IDF and n-grams, and incorporating scene-level context to improve the results.

## Key Features

- Improved text pre-processing for cleaner data
- Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF and n-grams
- Added scene-based context for better classification
- Parameter tuning to find the best setup
- Evaluated performance using metrics like mean rank and accuracy
